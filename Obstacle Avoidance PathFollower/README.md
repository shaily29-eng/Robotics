# TOPIC: Obstacle Avoidance PathFollower

## The robot is created using the Webots IDE and programmed in Python, was designed to have two functionalities. The first function is as a line tracker. Using three infrared sensors in front of the robot, it was programmed to follow a black line. Additionally, the robot can dodge obstacles found blocking the path with the help of distance sensors on the sides. To see the robot's line-tracking and obstacle avoidance capabilities in action, check out the demonstration video.

## The second functionality of the robot is to act as a web socket server. Our teacher requested that the robot host a socket server that could respond to an HTTP request with the current image captured by the camera on top of the robot. By implementing this web socket server, we were able to expand the robot's capabilities beyond simply line tracking and obstacle avoidance.
