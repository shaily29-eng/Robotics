## TOPIC: Autonomous Multi-Agent Area Coverage

#### Autonomous Multi-Agent Area Coverage is a project that focuses on using multiple agents to cover a given area and find objects. The main goal is to divide the work and area equally among the agents and share the found objects using Cooperative Perceptional Messages as common knowledge for all the agents in the field. This approach enables efficient area coverage and object discovery, making it an attractive solution for various applications.

#### The project can be divided into two main parts: Exploration and Area Division. In the Exploration phase, the agents explore and find the described object in the environment using the Webots simulator. Webots simulator provides a user-friendly interface and a library of various robots to choose from. The robots are equipped with a basic contour detection code, which can detect the green spheres placed around the environment.

#### In the Area Division phase, the area is divided among the agents using an algorithm designed for optimal multi-robot coverage path planning. The agents share their found objects using Cooperative Perceptional Messages as common knowledge for all the agents in the field.

#### To run this project, Python 3.6, Webots simulator, OpenCV and its dependencies, Flask, Requests, Matplotlib, Pygame, PyQt, and supporting libraries are required. The Autonomous Multi-Agent Area Coverage project showcases the potential of using multiple agents for efficient area coverage and object discovery, and provides a solid foundation for future research and development in this field.
