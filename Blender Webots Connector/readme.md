## Blender Webots Connector

#### The Blender Webots Connector enables users to export their Blender projects to Webots. This add-on provides a seamless connection between the two platforms, allowing for easy and efficient project transfers.

#### One of the key features of the Blender Webots Connector is the ability to define conversion rules in a JSON file. This feature provides users with greater flexibility and control over the export process. Additionally, the add-on supports collision export, either generated from the AABB boxes or manually defined, as well as joint export with custom parameters including axis, limits, and more.

#### Another notable feature of the Blender Webots Connector is its ability to export any Webots Solid node or derived node with custom fields such as Camera.width and name. The add-on also offers basic support for materials including colors and the base color map, to Webots PBR appearance.

#### To use this powerful tool, Blender 2.79b is required. Additionally, the latest version of Webots (R2019a.rev1 or later) must be installed. By leveraging the Blender Webots Connector, users can easily transfer their Blender projects to Webots, opening up a range of new possibilities for their designs and projects.
